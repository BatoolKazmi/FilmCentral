## Summary

FilmCentral is a movie tracking app designed to help users organize and manage their movie-watching experience. Users can browse a comprehensive movie catalog, create a personalized watchlist, and track movies they’ve completed. It allows users to prioritize what they want to watch, filter and search for specific movies, and record scores for completed films. The app offers seamless transitions between the watchlist and the completed list, empowering users to manage and update their lists with ease.

## Key Features and Functionality
- **View the Entire Movie Catalogue:** Users can browse through all the movies in the app’s database, providing access to a vast collection of films.
- **Detailed Movie Information:** Clicking on a movie allows users to view more detailed information, such as its genre, director, release year, and a synopsis.
- **Filter Movies:** Users can filter movies by category, genre, or director. For example, users can find "other romances" or "movies by Ghibli" to explore similar films within the catalog.
- **Search for Movies:** A search feature allows users to quickly find specific movies by typing in the title or keywords.
- **Quick Add to Watchlist:** From the main page, users can instantly add a movie to their plan-to-watch list without adding extra details. It is added with a default priority.
- **Sort Watchlist by Priority:** The watchlist is automatically sorted by the priority assigned to each movie, helping users focus on movies they want to watch most urgently.
- **Update Movie Priority on Watchlist:** Users can adjust the priority level of any movie in their watchlist based on how eagerly they want to watch it.
- **Mark Movies as Watched:** Once a user has watched a movie, they can mark it as "watched," which removes it from the plan-to-watch list and moves it to the completed list.
- **Add Scores to Completed Movies:** After marking a movie as watched, users can give it a score, either at the time of completion or later. This allows users to keep track of how they rated each movie they've seen.
- **Sort Completed Movies:** The completed list can be sorted by either the score given to each movie or the date it was watched, offering flexible viewing options.
- **Track Multiple Viewings:** If a user watches a movie more than once, they can update the completed list to reflect how many times they've seen it.
- **Remove Movies from the Watchlist:** If a user decides not to watch a movie they added to their plan-to-watch list, they can remove it easily, whether due to a change of mind or an accidental add.
