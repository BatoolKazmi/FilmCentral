## Minimal Requirements 

- [x] I want to be able to **see all the movies** in the catalogue
- [x] I want to be able to **find more detailed information about a movie**
- [x] I want to have at least one way to filter the movies in the catalog
  - i.e Maybe I want to find similar movies (i.e. "other romances", "other movies by Ghibli")
- [x] I want to be able to **search for a specific movie**

- [x] I want to "quick add" a movie to my plan-to-watch list from the main page, with no notes and a default priority
- [x] I want to see all the movies on my watch list sorted by priority
- [x] I want to be able to update the priority of a movie on my watchlist

- [ ] I want to be able to mark a movie as watched once I've seen it (which should remove it from my watch list and place it on the completed list)
- [x] I want to be able to add a score onto a movie that I've seen (either when moving it to completed or later)
- [x] I want to be able to see all my finished movies sorted by score or date watched (developers choice)
- [x] I want to be able to update the number of times I've watched a movie on my completed list if I've watched it again
- sorted by rating

- [ ] I want to be able to remove things from my planning list even if I don't end up watching it (e.g., I added the wrong one, or I changed my mind, etc)

## Bonus Stuff
- Pagination (allowed me to add all 4000 movies in the movie list!)
- Used Matt's SQL table to find different genres in the movie list
